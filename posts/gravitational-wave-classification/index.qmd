# What are Gravitational Waves?

Gravitational Waves are the "ripples" in the fabric of spacetime produced by the motion of massive objects. They were first predicted in 1916 by Albert Einstein as a direct consequence of General Relativity. According to Einstein's General Relativity, space and time is a considered together as a 4 dimensional structure as a whole.The precense of mass/energy causes spacetime to curve, and the curvature is what we preceive as gravity.

When massive objects starts moving or accelerating, the curvature of spacetime also changes accordingly, the changes in the curvature results in gravitional waves and propagate across the universe with the speed of light. A simple analogy is to imagine the wavefront created by dipping your finger into still water and moving your finger across the surface. 

Not all moving objects produce gravitational waves strong enough to detect. Everyday motions—such as a person walking or a car driving—do generate gravitational waves, but their effects are unimaginably small. The gravitational wave we are interested in are the ones created by extremely massive objects (multiple solar masses!) undergoing violent acceleration. Examples include binary systems of blackholes, neutron stars, and supernova explosions, etc.

One of the most powerful and well-studied sources of gravitational waves is a binary system consisting of two black holes or neutron stars. As two massive objects orbits each other, the orbital velocity increases as the two objects get closer, producing gravitional waves with higher amplitude and frequency as shown in @fig-gravitational-wave. 

Gravitational waves provide a fundamentally new way of observing the universe. Traditional astronomy relies almost entirely on electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays. However, they are limited by the fact that light can be absorbed, scattered, or blocked by matter such as dust clouds, gas, or dense stellar environments. On the other hand, Gravitational waves interact extremely weakly with matter. This allows them to travel largely unimpeded across the universe, carrying pristine information about the most extreme astrophysical events. Allowing scientists to probe regions of the universe that are otherwise inaccessible, such as black hole mergers.

# How do we Observe Gravitational Waves
Detecting gravitational waves is an extraordinary technological challenge due to how weak gravitational waves interact with matter. One of the most successful instruments designed for this purpose is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). A simplified schematic diagram of a gravitational-wave detector is shown in @fig-detector-schematic.

Each LIGO detector is essentially a giant laser interferometer with 2 perpendicular arms, each approximately 4 kilometers long. The schematic of the detection process 

1. A highly stable, powerful laser generates a continuous beam of coherent light with a well-defined wavelength and phase.
2. The laser beam is directed toward a beam splitter, which divides it into two identical beams.
3. The two beams travel down two perpendicular vacuum arms, each approximately 4 kilometers long.
4. Mirrors suspended at the end of each arm reflect the beams back toward the beam splitter.
5. The reflected beams return to the beam splitter, where they recombine.
6. The recombined light forms an interference pattern that depends on the relative phase difference between the two beams, which is determined by the arm lengths. Under normal conditions, they are calibrated to interfere destructively, so the lasers from two arms cancels perfectly when there's nothing to detect.
7. When a gravitational wave passes through the detector, it stretches one arm and compresses the other, causing a tiny change in the relative path lengths of the two beams. The difference in arm lengths introduces a phase shift between the two beams, changing the interference pattern, resulting in light reaching the photodetector, producing a measurable signal.
8. The output from the photodetector is then recorded and analyzed using advanced data-processing techniques to determine whether the signal is consistent with a gravitational wave or noise.

# The Chirp Signal

As the blackholes orbits each other, the distance between the two blackholes decrease, increasing the angular velocity, which increases the frequency of the gravitational wave. If the signal is converted to sound, it sounds like a chirp, which is why it is often reffered to as a chirp signal.](img/LIGO_measurement_of_gravitational_waves.svg.png){width=80% .lightbox #fig-first-observation}

The first detection of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015 is shown in @fig-first-observation. The signal is known as GW150914, produced by the merger of two blackholes with 36 solar masses and 29 solar masses 1.3 billion lightyears away, detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Which led to the awarding of the [2017 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2017/summary/)

The detected waveform clearly exhibits the characteristic “chirp” pattern predicted by General Relativity. As the black holes spiraled closer together, the frequency and amplitude of the gravitational waves increased rapidly, culminating in a sharp peak at the moment of merger, followed by a brief “ringdown” phase as the newly formed black hole settled into a stable state. When this signal is converted into audio, it produces a rising tone reminiscent of a bird’s chirp.

# Sensitivity, Noise, Classification Task
The detectors are extremely sensitive because they need to measure the incredibly tiny distortions of spacetime caused by gravitational waves. According to LIGO, the detectors need to be able to tell whether the length of a 4km arm changes by a distance 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a proton @ligo20161018. To put this into perspective, this is roughly equivalent to measuring the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System with an accuracy smaller than the width of a human hair.

This extreme sensitivity means they pick up many other sources of vibration, such as earthquakes, traffic, thermal vibratoins of atoms in the mirrors, quantum fluctuations of the laser, and so on. These unwanted signals are referred to glitches. Example of different types of glitches observed in LIGO are shown in @fig-glitches. The majority of the sources of the glitches are still unknoen. These glitches have multiple patterns and some can closely resemble real gravitional wave signals. Making this a really challenging classification task to distinguish true astophysical events from noise.

To address this challenge, scientists use a combination of advanced data analysis techniques, including machine learning techinuqies such as random forest classifier @shah2023wavesforestrandomforest, image classification @alvarezlopez2023gspynettreesignalvsglitchclassifiergravitationalwave,and cross-correlation between multiple detectors. LIGO operates two detectors in the United States, while additional observatories such as Virgo in Europe and KAGRA in Japan contribute to a global network. A genuine gravitational-wave signal should appear in multiple detectors with consistent timing and waveform properties, while local noise sources typically affect only one detector.

Citizen science projects such as Gravity Spy further assist researchers by enlisting the public to help classify glitches. By combining human pattern recognition with machine learning algorithms, these projects improve the reliability and efficiency of gravitational-wave detection pipelines.
