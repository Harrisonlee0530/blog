Hello there!

I am a highly motivated graduate student in Masters of Data Science @ UBC with a strong foundation in physics and computational methods, interested in data science and computational modeling for solving real-world problems. My academic journey has equipped me with a diverse skill set spanning physics, mathematics, and programming, which I apply to tackle complex challenges. I am eager to contribute my analytical abilities and technical expertise to innovative projects while continuing to expand my knowledge and professional experience in my graduate studies.
