    "text": "Figure 1: Image of gravitational wave — Courtesy Caltech/MIT/LIGO Laboratory (LIGO Laboratory 2015)\n\n\n\nGravitational Waves are the “ripples” in spacetime produced by the motion of massive objects predicted by Einstein’s General Relativity. According to Einstein’s General Relativity, the precense of mass/energy curves space time, when the massive object starts moving, the curvature of spacetime also changes accordingly. The gravitational wave we are interested in are the ones created by massive objects such as binary systems of blackholes and neutron stars. As two massive objects orbits each other, it creates a spiral gravitational wave as shown in Figure 1.\nThis allows astrophysicists to observe the universe in a new way other than using electromagnetic radiation. Since gravitational waves interacts very weakly with matter, we can detect the waves without distortions from objects between us and the source of the astronomical event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A Simplified Schematic diagram of a LIGO detector (Commons 2020)\n\n\n\nA simplified schematic diagram of a gravitational-wave detector is shown in Figure 2. A laser beam is sent to a beam splitter, where it is divided into two beams that travel along perpendicular paths, each about 4 km long. At the end of each path, mirrors reflect the beams back toward the beam splitter, where they recombine and are measured by a photodetector. The detector is calibrated so the two beams are out of phase and cancel each other when they recombine under normal circumstances. When a gravitational wave passes through the detector, it slightly stretches one arm while compressing the other, changing the lengths of the paths. This prevents the beams from canceling perfectly, producing a signal that indicates the presence of a gravitational wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: First measurement of gravitational waves GW150914 (Commons 2025). As the blackholes orbits each other, the distance between the two blackholes decrease, increasing the angular velocity, which increases the frequency of the gravitational wave. If the signal is converted to sound, it sounds like a chirp, which is why it is often reffered to as a chirp signal.\n\n\n\nThe first detection of gravitational waves occurred in 2015 (see Figure 3, 2017 Physics Nobel Prize), caused by binary blackhole merger 1.3 billion lightyears away, detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).\nHowever, the detectors are extremely sensitive because they need to measure the incredibly tiny distortions of spacetime caused by gravitational waves. According to LIGO, the detectors need to be able to tell whether the length of a 4km arm change by a distance 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a proton LIGO Laboratory (2016). This extreme sensitivity also means they pick up many other sources of vibration, such as earthquakes, traffic, or local environmental noise known as glitches Figure 4. As a result, classifying which signals are true gravitational waves and noise is a critical and challenging task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Different classes of glitches in Gravity Spy, a crowd source classification project by LIGO Glanzer et al.
